            üé® Hi there! I'm Wayne Chen, born and raised in Taipei in 2000. As an Aries, I bring to
            the table a unique blend of resilience and optimism, making me well-equipped to handle
            stressful situations.** One of my greatest joys in life is indulging in books and
            movies. There's something magical about diving into a captivating story or exploring
            different worlds through cinema. What's even more fulfilling is sharing these
            experiences with friends, exchanging thoughts and insights that often spark lively
            discussions. My love for storytelling doesn't stop there. It has fueled my passion for
            writing and honed my aesthetic sensibilities. Every book I read and every movie I watch
            adds a layer of richness to my creativity and expression. Looking ahead, I'm eager to
            further develop my English proficiency and computer skills. I believe these skills will
            not only help me navigate the complexities of the modern workplace but also open up new
            avenues for growth and exploration.
